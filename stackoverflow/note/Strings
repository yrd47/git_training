In order to compare Strings for equality, you should use the String object's equals or equalsIgnoreCase methods.
Do not use the == opreator to compare Strings.
When comparing a String to a constant value, you can put the constant value on the left side of equals to ensure that you won't get a NullPointerException if the other String is null.
